# Manual Testing 

## Part 1 User stories 1 - 5 

These stories all focus on what a shopper expects to see in the site and are all related together.

1. View a list of products . This is readily available to the shopper , they can click on the all products link in the nav or the shop now button and this will take them to the all products page. All works like its supposed to.

2. View a single products details. This is achieved by selecting the desired product from the all products page or 
by filtering or searching and clicking on the image. This brought me to the product details page where I could see the chosen 
products details.

3. See Below

4. These can be seen from the same test as they are purely visual, you can see on the banner underneath the navbar that theres 15% off for registered users and the shopping bag icon is counting the grand total see image below

5. This is for customers to see what they have spent and to see if they have received any discounts.This can be seen in the bottom right hand
corner of the shopping bag. While here I noticed that I accidently put the dollar sign in 2 totals, I fixed that now.

## User Stories 6 - 12

6. Its easy to register for an account, I have done this through All auth and customized the look of it. Just pressed the log in button in the navbar under my account, it brought me to the register screen. I created an account , I got sent the confirmation email, I followed the link and all worked as expected.

7. After creating an account I tried to log in with the details provided. IT worked as expected

8. Logging out was achieved by going to the navbar clicking on my account I was brought to the log out page. I clicked log out , all worked as intended.

9. I wasnt able to implement this feature yet

10. When users complete an order they can save their default delivery details, I expanded this a little further and on the profile screen they can add a profile pic and their favourite genre. This all works as intended making checkout faster but this is the foundation for future features.

11. This will be implemented in a future release.

12. Receive an email confirmation after registering. I tried the whole process and it all worked as intended.

All these user stories are related and I tested them in the same process so below are some screenshots of the tests.

## User Stories 13 -17

These user stories all focus on the sorting and searching for products and returning the requested products. I tested all the sorting and
search functions in the nav bar and all worked as expected.
