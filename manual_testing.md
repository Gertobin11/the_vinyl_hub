# Manual Testing 

## Part 1 User stories 1 - 5 

These stories all focus on what a shopper expects to see in the site and are all related together.

1. View a list of products . This is readily available to the shopper , they can click on the all products link in the nav or the shop now button and this will take them to the all products page. All works like its supposed to.

2. View a single products details. This is achieved by selecting the desired product from the all products page or 
by filtering or searching and clicking on the image. This brought me to the product details page where I could see the chosen 
products details.
