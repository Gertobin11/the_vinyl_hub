The reason: there’s a lot to like, starting with build options that let you pick the base color, platter material (acrylic in the photo), cartridge, and more. U-Turn’s minimal, plug & play design is ideal for beginners and we had ours up and running in less than 5 minutes. There’s no short-cutting when it comes to sound; even our most finicky audio pros give the new Orbit Plus a thumbs up.\r\n\r\nU-Turn not only builds every Orbit Plus by hand in their Boston plant but they also assign an audio technician to listen to each before sending it along. (Impressive for this price range.) The only button on the Orbit Plus is for power – there’s no speed switch; you have to manually switch the belt from one groove to another to change RPM speed. If you’re a hands-on type, no biggie… but if you’d prefer a switch that changes speed for you, the Orbit Plus isn’t for you. (Do you really listen to that many 45s?)\r\n\r\nA straight, understated tonearm glides on a pivot-style bearing positioned close to the record, which allows for more accurate groove tracking.  One detail to note is that this does not come with a cue lever built-in.  U-Turn offers a cue lever as an optional attachment which you can find here.  Each Orbit does ship with the cartridge already installed and tracking force perfectly calibrated, which is great for beginners.   \r\n\r\nP.S.

At the time, most consumer turntables were fully automatic. People listinening to  would put a record on the platter, push a button, and they were done.  From there, the turntable picks up the tonearm, places it over the beginning of the record, gently puts it down, and voilà, music. At the end of the record, the turntable automatically lifts the tonearm, gently puts it back in its holder, and then turns itself off. Convenient, yes, but fully automatic is more about not accidentally scratching your records.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, given the DP-300F’s preamp (included) can be turned on or off, you can plug it into almost any integrated amp or receiver – even those without a phono input port. This allows the DP-300F to work with almost every home music system. Switching out the cartridge is easy too, should you ever decide to upgrade for something with a bigger range. Do that, and the Denon DP-300F is easily on par with record players that cost two or three times as much. As for looks, the DP-300F is attractive yet unassuming, a classic look built on 4mm thick cabinet walls made of die-cast aluminum.

It comes in Steinway gloss black and sets it up in 10/15 minutes. And with both line and phono outputs (RCA jacks), you can hardwire everything like it’s 1973, or download the MusicCast app and start streaming literally anything from anywhere. (Your favorite Internet radio stations, your digital collection, whatever.)  But, the real magic happens when you put an album on the VINYL 500. We did exactly that with a pair of stereo MusicCast speakers hooked up, and the experience was everything one would hope for with a top of the line turntable: incredibly warm with deep, round lows and crisp, clear highs. All in all, very human. \r\n\r\nSo to the question: is the analog turntable experience – the one everyone is raving about – even possible in a wireless environment?

It’s about an ever-evolving turntable conceived and built by two devoted lovers of music, Tony Relph and Roy Gandy, and how they keep finding ways to extract every bit of fidelity out of treasured LPs – essentially perfecting a much-beloved product over the course of 40+ years. \r\n\r\nHighlights include: a high-gloss acrylic laminate plinth designed for low mass and high stiffness. A “floating-glass” flywheel platter with Optiwhite polished rim, topped with a felt mat, and a low-mass, low-friction tonearm with precision bearings and steel counterweight – the result of 40 years of research and experimentation.  Rega’s own Elys 2 moving magnet cartridge will come factory fitted with this version of the Planar 3. The Planar 3 really sings with the Elys 2 MM cartridge onboard.\r\n\r\nThe Planar 3 is hailed the world over as the highest-value, entry-level, audiophile record player since its original introduction back in 1977, and it’s as much a conversation piece as it is a true high-fidelity component. Hi-Fi named its predecessor “Product of the Year” three years running.
