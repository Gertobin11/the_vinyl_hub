# The Vinyl Hub

## Table of Contents

## Project Overview
The Vinyl Hub is an e-commerce site selling classic vinyls, audio accessories and record players.
It aims to build a customer base by providing high quality products and also developing a community,
by allowing registered user a way to interact and show their vinyl collections by filling out a profile form.
Registered users would also have the ability to request albums that could be added to the store.


### User Stories 
I built my user stories in an agile framework where I built upon the foundations laid in 
the code institue's Boutique Ado project and tailored them to the needs of my projects users and store owner.
The table below are the stories upon which this project was built

## UX

### Design Choices 

The overall structure of the site is based off bootstrap 5's row and column classes.
The colours and overall theme of the site is based off a vibrant 80's colour pallette, i.e. MTV'S 80's logo.

From these images I decided on `#fcb014`, `#c01b21`and `#018bd4` as this would have the feel and style from the 80's,
a time when Vinyls were at their peak.
